##NOTE! Every sound in /usr/share/SS/System/Sounds needs to be in mp3 format!
##DM and Lock need to be jpg and png, respectivly.

Hello. SS is a folder in /usr/share.
It stands for, "Super Share."
Out of the box, permissions will be WRONG. To fix this, please run the automated script.
SS comes with sounds and themes. You can delete and modify everything in SS/Themes,
as long as these conditions are met:

1: To keep tidy, do not leave loose images in this folder.
2: In order for certain BLWS applications to work, the file structure must be as follows:
	themename/Gfx: Graphics folder
	themename/Sfx: Recommended, but not required. (Sound themes generally go in
	SS/System/Sounds/Themes, anyway.)

That's all! Now on to the System folder.
SS/System/ contains Sounds/ and DM.jpg. DM.jpg, when used with the optional
LXDM configuration, will be used on the main logon screen. You could change
other DMs to do the same.

SS/System/Sounds/ is an important part of BLWS apps. If you use the apps, sound will
be heard, depending on events.

SS/System/Sounds/guest & /snowyclaw: These are example user folders. You should exclude
Shutdown.mp3 and Startup.mp3, as they will not be used. You can delete these example
folders, if you wish.
If you want sounds for your user, create the directories like this:
SS/System/Sounds/USER. Doing this will enable sounds for you or others.

Recommended perms:
User folders should be owned by that user and have 0755 (rwxr-xr-x) permissions.

SS/System/Sounds/root: This is root's main sound files. **Needed!**
SS/System/Sounds/Themes: Sound themes for the users. This folder is not constructed in
a special way. While not needed to have this folder, it's strongly recommended to keep
organized.
